# The `mine.*` namespace: everything about this repo that is a property of the
# person or the machine rather than of the software being configured.
#
# It is declared with the module system rather than passed around as
# `specialArgs` on purpose: options get types, error messages that name the
# option that is missing, and a schema that the setup wizard (#5) can read back
# and render as prompts.
#
# Identity has no defaults. A fork that forgets to set `mine.user.name` gets a
# loud "option ... is used but not defined" naming the option, instead of a
# machine quietly configured as david.

        a private `git+ssh://` flake input fetch with the right key when the

  options.mine.desktop = {
    aerospace.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      the AeroSpace tiling window manager, configured from

    '';

    sketchybar.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      the SketchyBar status bar
    '';

    betterdisplay.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      BetterDisplay: installs the cask and `betterdisplaycli`, a wrapper round
      the CLI that the cask hides inside its .app bundle. With `raycast.enable`
      below, also brings Raycast's ultra-wide script commands, which are
      `betterdisplaycli` calls
    '';

    dock.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      declarative management of the macOS Dock. When on, the Dock is either
      populated from `local.dock.entries` or stripped entirely, depending on
      `local.dock.enable`. When off, this config does not touch the Dock at all,
      which is what you want on a machine whose Dock someone else arranged
    '';

    raycast.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      Raycast: installs the cask, sets its hotkey to Control-D and starts it
      at login. With `betterdisplay.enable` above, also renders the script
      commands from modules/config/raycast into ~/.config/raycast/scripts;
      they drive `betterdisplaycli` and mean nothing without it. Raycast still
      has to be pointed at that directory by hand, once — see that directory's
      readme

      Claude Code's configuration: `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/skills`
      and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` become symlinks to modules/config/claude, so the
      files Claude Code reads are the files this repo tracks and a skill added
      by hand is versioned without a rebuild. Also merges the MCP server list
      into `~/.claude.json`, which cannot be symlinked because it is mostly
      machine state. Does not install Claude Code itself — that is a cask, named
      in `hosts/<hostname>`. See docs/two-paths.md for why this module is shaped
      unlike every other one here
    '';

    datagrip.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      DataGrip: installs the cask and applies
      `mine.programs.datagrip.datasources` as global datasources, so the same
      connections are in every project on every machine. Off means this config
      does not install DataGrip and never touches its files
    '';

    xcode.enable = lib.mkEnableOption ''
      Xcode from the Mac App Store, plus the root-only setup it needs before
      `xcodebuild` works: `xcode-select` pointed at it, the license accepted,
      and the first-launch components installed. Requires a one-time sign-in
      to App Store.app; see `mine.homebrew.masApps`
    '';

  # What to install from Homebrew. This is the "wanted by a person" half of the
  # split in #9: modules/homebrew.nix keeps the activation policy and names no
  # packages at all, and every package name that is pure preference is set in
  # hosts/<hostname>.
  #
  # The other half — a cask a module cannot work without, like BetterDisplay for
  # `mine.desktop.betterdisplay` — is declared by that module against
  # `homebrew.casks` directly, the way `services.foo.enable` pulls `pkgs.foo`
  # upstream. Those merge with what is set here; nobody has to list them.

        Mac App Store apps to install with `mas`, as name = App Store id (the
        number in the app's apps.apple.com URL). The name is only a label.

        Needs a one-time sign-in to App Store.app first: `mas` cannot sign in
        on current macOS, and without an account the activation fails at the
        Homebrew step. Removing an app from here does not uninstall it, so it
        behaves the same as `cleanup = "none"` does for casks.

        Extra taps to make available to `brew bundle`.

        Note that flake.nix sets `nix-homebrew.mutableTaps = false`, so taps are
        pinned and cloned from the store; a tap named here also has to be added
        to `nix-homebrew.taps` there, or the activation will try to fetch it and
        fail. The option exists so a fork that wants mutable taps has the seam
        already in place.

        This is not the route for adding a tap day to day: `brew tap` (#35)
        records the pin in modules/homebrew/taps.nix, which flake.nix fetches
        and merges into `extraTaps` for you.

        The third-party taps this repo ships are not listed through here: they
        are pinned and marked `trusted` next to `nix-homebrew.taps` in flake.nix,
        which Homebrew 6 requires before it will load anything out of them.
