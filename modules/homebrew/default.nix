# Homebrew: policy and wiring, and no package names.
#
# What lives here is the part every machine shares — Homebrew is on, and how it
# behaves during an activation. *What* gets installed is a property of the
# person or the machine, so it comes from `mine.homebrew.*` (declared in
# modules/options.nix) and is set in hosts/<hostname> (#9).
#
# Modules add to these lists too, for the one case that is not taste: a module
# that shells out to an app bundle needs that cask the way `services.foo.enable`
# needs `pkgs.foo` upstream. `homebrew.casks` is a list option, so those
# contributions merge with whatever the host asked for; see
# modules/desktop/betterdisplay for the shape.
